Description:
  Engineers typically need to show working out as part of the solution process for quality assurance and checking. 
  `engcalc` uses the symbolic manipulation capability of the `Ryacas` package to solve engineering calculations
  such as those found in structural engineering or other technical disciplines and it enables the user to also see the
  substituted, but not solved equation so that the origin of each variable is traceable and the solution can be validated and verified.
